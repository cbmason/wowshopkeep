# ShopKeep, by Zensmash (US-Kromcrush) <archerrez4@gmail.com>

Addon to simplify the business side of Enchanting.  Allows the user to auto-respond to prospective customers when they PM certain keywords.  Originally written for TBC Classic

## User commands (for configuration)

`/shopkeep config`              - brings up the main configuration dialog
`/shopkeep enable`              - enable autoresponses
`/shopkeep disable`             - disable autoresponses

## Customer commands

The first keyword of each customer command (default: enchants) can be changed in configuration.

`shopkeep help`             - responds with a help message
`shopkeep rare`             - responds with a list of the "rarest" enchants available.  This list is auto-populated, but can be manually set as well
`shopkeep <slot> <type>`    - <slot> can be "head," "helm," "legs," "pants," anything like that.  <type> is the state added i.e. "healing," "strength," etc.
