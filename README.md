# ShopKeep

Addon to simplify the business side of trade skills.  Allows prospective customers to search through your available recipes, and the addon will auto-respond with matching recipe links (showing mats etc.).  Individually configurable to work on  say / guild / party / raid, always enabled for whisper.  Requests consist of a keyword "!shop" followed by any search text.  Originally written for TBC Classic.
